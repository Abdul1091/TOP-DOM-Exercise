# Overview
The project starts with an HTML skeleton with a container <div>. The JavaScript file:

The end result includes elements with specific styles and text content added to the DOM when the page loads.

# Features
* Adds a <p> element with red text.
* Adds an <h3> element with blue text.
* Adds a <div> with a black border and pink background containing:
    * An <h1> with text.
    * A <p> with text.

# Technologies
* HTML
* JavaScript

# Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in your browser to see the elements being added dynamically.

# Usage
* To view the dynamic DOM changes, open index.html in a browser.
* Modify script.js to add or style new elements as practice for DOM manipulation.
